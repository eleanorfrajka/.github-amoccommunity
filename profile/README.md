## AMOC Community

Here the OceanGliders community shares and discusses best practices, data formats and vocabularies. 
It fulfils the expectations of the CLIVAR AMOC Task Team towards making AMOC observational data easier to access.


### How to contribute

We are an open community! If you want to join the effort just browse through the different repositories, raise issues or start a discussion. A good start is also to introduce yourself in the <a href="https://github.com/AMOCcommunity/.github/discussions">Discussions.</a>

### Initial community efforts

- <a href="http://github.com/AMOCcommunity/amocarray">amocarray</a> repository for access AMOC array data.

## AMOC data

### RAPID 26°N

- **Website:** [https://rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc/](https://rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc/)
- **Data:** Data are provided in several formats, including `*.nc` or netCDF format, including vertically-gridded temperature and salinity data, the overturning volume transport streamfunction (as a function of depth and time), and a few other auxiliary products.
- **Latest:** Data are usually within 6 months of a cruise completion. As of April 2025, data are available partway through 2023.

### OSNAP - Overturning in the subpolar North Atlantic p

- **Website:** [https://www.o-snap.org](https://www.o-snap.org)
- **Data:** Data are provided in `*.nc` or netCDF format, including gridded fields of temperature, salinity and velocity, and overturning transports in depth and density space for both OSNAP east (east of Greenland) and OSNAP west (west of Greenland).
- **Latest:** Data as published in [Fu et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00848-9) (for the period 2014-2020) are available (as of April 2025).

### SAMBA 34.5°S -  South Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation Basin-wide Array (SAMBA)

- **Website:** [https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/SAMOC_international/](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/SAMOC_international/)
- **Data:** Data are available for MOC volume transport anomalies as `*.txt` or `*.asc` text files.
- **Latest:** Transport data from Kersale et al. (2020) and Meinen et al. (2018) are available (as of April 2025).

### MOVE 16°N - Meridional overturning variability

- **Website:** [https://mooring.ucsd.edu/move/](https://mooring.ucsd.edu/move/)
- **Data:** Data for the North Atlantic Deep Water transport (1200-4950m) volume transport is available [here](https://mooring.ucsd.edu/move/nc/OS_MOVE_TRANSPORTS.nc)
- **Latest:** Transport data until August 18, 2022 are available (as of April 2025).
